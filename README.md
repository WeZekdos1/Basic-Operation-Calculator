# Basic-Operation-Calculator
this is a terminal-based basic operation calculator app written in C++ with OOP. i use CMake and Ninja as the build system and G++ as the compiler, this is my first C++ project btw

**How to build my code**
1. Create the 'build' directory
```
mkdir -p build
```
2. Generate build files using CMake and Ninja
```
cmake ../ -G Ninja
```
3. Compile the code using ninja
```
ninja

You can also use any other build system or compiler to build my code
